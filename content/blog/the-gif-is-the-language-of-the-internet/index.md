We use GIFs everywhere these days. From being an obscure part of meme culture, they are now a part of every main communication channel. 

You can share GIFs on social media, as part of your blogpost, and these days they are even supported by Outlook. 

I've seen GIF's used in everything from Buzzfeed (of course) to explainers for difficult to understand economic corruption cases. 

We use GIF's in messaging, either via 3rd party custom GIF keyboards, or directly built in to our favorite IM tool, to Apple iMessages and even in the workplace via Slack or Teams. 

This last part is crucial, because one of the main vendors here is called [Giphy](https://giphy.com), and it just got acquired by [Facebook for $400 million](https://www.axios.com/scoop-facebook-to-buy-giphy-for-400-million-4a75a359-833b-484d-b15b-87e94d3de017.html). 

Think about this for a moment. Giphy is by far the biggest GIF hub on the internet, worth enough for Facebook - the _biggest_ site on the internet - to pay such an enormous amount of money for it and not just build it's own. 

Giphy has been trusted by so many products as an easy way to support GIFs in their apps or social platforms. You search for keywords like 'thank you' or 'friday', and Giphy will bring up thousands of options ready for you to send away to your friends or coworkers.
